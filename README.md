## Description

PizzaCraft is a new little gem hidden away in Kiambu. Established in 2020, PizzaCraft has been serving the local community with a new standard. They are always pushing the highest standard and melting away expectations. With this moderate success among the locals, PizzaCraft has decided to go digital and serve clients from all over Kenya. This web application enables the user to create their own pizza and place an order for it.
